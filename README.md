# Ziglings

Welcome to Ziglings! This project contains a series of tiny broken programs.
By fixing them, you'll learn how to read and write
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
code.

This contains my solutions to Ziglings and you can find them in the `solutions` branch. For the original repo, please visit https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings.
